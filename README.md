This is about creating your own webpage using HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX. Its just a fun and simple project that you can use for learning.

First of CSS is uesd to style the HTML page. The following is the list of Cascading Style sheets I had to make for this project:
1. add_events.css
2. homepage.css
3. students_page.css
4. style.css

Also attached few pictures, pic1.jpg to pic7.jpg and avatar.png, avatar2.svg. These are used as background images and for login ,sign up.

Now coming to the HTML files:
1. homepage.html
2. contact.html
3. aboutus.html
4. chooseprofile.html

When you check the aboutus there is a xml related script enclosed in between the tags <script>.... </script>. You can delete those lines if you do not want them else you can modify the xml file (xmlfile.xml).

Php related files are:
1. config.php
2. logout.php
