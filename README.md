This is about creating your own webpage using HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX. Its just a fun and simple project that you can use for learning.

First of CSS is uesd to style the HTML page. The following is the list of Cascading Style sheets I had to make for this project:
1. add_events.css
2. homepage.css
3. students_page.css
4. style.css

Also attached few pictures, pic1.jpg to pic7.jpg and avatar.png, avatar2.svg. These are used as background images and for login ,sign up.

Now coming to the HTML files:
1. homepage.html
2. contact.html
3. aboutus.html
4. chooseprofile.html

>> chooseprofile helps you to choose the login as user or admin.

>> When you check the aboutus there is a xml related script enclosed in between the tags <script>.... </script>. You can delete those lines if you do not want them else you can modify the xml file (xmlfile.xml).

Php related files are:
1. config.php 
2. logout.php

>> Config file allows you to connect to your "phpmyadmin" server. The server name is localhost, you will login as "root" and if its password protected give you password else just leave it like this "". Now you give your database name, in my case it is "login".

>> logout file allows you to disonnect from the server.
